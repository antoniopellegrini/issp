# Implement a PRNG based on AES in counter mode, and use it to generate a key
# to encrypt the messages between Alice and Bob.
#
# Hint: You can use either the AES class from the issp module or implement your own.
#       In both cases, it is a good idea to omit the PKCS7 padding to ensure that the output
#       is always the same size as the input.
